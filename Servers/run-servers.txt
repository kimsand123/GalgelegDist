** Servers ** 

These are the servers you can run.


If you want to open the servers with a terminal,
then open up a terminal at this folder.

- AuthServer:
	* python3 AuthServer/manage.py runserver [::]:8970
		- You must have python installed on your system

- GameServer:
	* java -cp GameServer/GameServer-1.0.jar server.GameServer

- EntryPointServer:
	* java -cp EntryPointServer/EntryPoint-1.0.jar server.EntryPointServer
		- You can add '1' at the end if you run locally
		- The entrypoint is depending on authserver and gameserver
